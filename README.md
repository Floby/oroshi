# Oroshi

This is my dotfiles repo. It contains most of my configuration as well as
convenient scripts to deploy, generate and more generally update my config.

Feel free to browse and borrow ideas from it.

## TODO

- [ ] Use `tig` for handling selective commits
- [ ] Use `cmus` for listening to music and bind pause/next to keyboard
- [ ] Use a terminal app to read/reply to my emails
- [ ] Fix vim autocompletion
- [ ] Improve the display of `doil` and `docl`
