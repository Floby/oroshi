# Awesome_print defaults.
# Awesome print only accept a small range of colors for its output. We'll try
# to get colors as close as our theme as we can. When not sure what a color is,
# we'll just put it to red, to easily spot it.
# Available colors are :
#   red, redish
#   green, greenish
#   yellow, yellowish
#   cyan, cyanish
#   blue, blueish
#   pale
#   purple, purpleish
