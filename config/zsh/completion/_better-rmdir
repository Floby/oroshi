#compdef better-rmdir
# This is simply a copy of the _directories file found in zsh default
# completion function.
# I want rmdir to use the trash instead of simply deleting files. But I also
# want `rmdir` to autocomplete only directories.
# If I simply alias rmdir to trash, I lose the directory autocomplete
# So I aliases rmdir to better-rmdir, and create this autocomplete for
# better-rmdir
