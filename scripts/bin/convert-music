#!/usr/bin/env zsh
# Note: This is a work in progress, I only throw ideas on what to do here.

# Accepts mp3 files as input.
# Will check their ID3 tags
# Will clear the useless ones (Comments, Encoder Settings, Zune, etc)
# Check the validity of the Track, Title, Album, Author. Issue a warning if
# different from id3 to name of file, but auto-fill id3 if empty.
# Maybe check the SampleRate, AudioBitrate, Duration and Filesize and see if
# something is weird and issue a warning ?
