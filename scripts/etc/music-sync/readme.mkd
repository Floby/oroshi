This project will allow me to synchronize my music collection accross various
devices.

First, it will create a file named `.syncinfo` in every music directory I'd
like to synchronize. This file will contain the device names with wich it needs
to be synchronized.

Then, the synchronization process will look to every `.syncinfo` file
containing the name of the target directory and copy its parent directory to
the target.
